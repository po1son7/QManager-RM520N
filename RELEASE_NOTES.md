# 🚀 QManager RM520N BETA v0.1.6

A focused hotfix for **TTL & Hop Limit Configuration** on RM520N-GL. Saving TTL/HL now reflects correctly in the UI and survives a page refresh — and disabling actually disables.

> One-click OTA from **System Settings → Software Update** if you're on v0.1.5. SSH/ADB is no longer required.

## 🛠️ Fixes

- **TTL/HL save no longer resets to disabled after refresh.** The live-state reader was passing a duplicate flag that legacy iptables on RM520N-GL rejects, so the form mistakenly reported "disabled" right after a successful save. The form now mirrors the actual kernel state.
- **TTL/HL disable now fully clears the rules.** The apply path used to remove only one rule per save, so duplicate or stale rules from past changes could survive a disable and silently re-appear in the UI. The chain is now drained completely on every apply, with a hard cap to prevent runaway loops.

## 📥 Installation

### Upgrading from v0.1.5

**System Settings → Software Update.** Click Download, then Install. No SSH/ADB needed. All settings preserved.

### Fresh Install

ADB or SSH into the modem and run:

```sh
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh \
  https://github.com/po1son7/QManager-RM520N/raw/refs/heads/cn/edition/qmanager-installer.sh && \
  bash /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh
```

### Upgrading from v0.1.4

**This one-time hop requires ADB or SSH** — the v0.1.4 update CGI lacks the sudo elevation needed to install v0.1.5+ cleanly. Run the same fresh-install command above; your settings, profiles, and password are preserved.
